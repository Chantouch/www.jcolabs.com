                    True individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. People who are
                    hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.

                    The job market of the future will consist of those jobs that robots cannot perform. Our blue-collar
                    work is pattern recognition, making sense of what you see. Gardeners will still have jobs because
                    every garden is different. The same goes for construction workers. The losers are white-collar
                    workers, low-level accountants, brokers, and agents.
